# Invoice and Order Processing Automation Using UiPath

## Project Overview

**Goal**
The objective of this project is to streamline the order and invoice processing for accountants by allowing them to run automations through a web interface. This system is designed to help accountants process orders and invoices efficiently by downloading relevant data from emails, processing it, and generating XML files that can be uploaded to a server.

**Description**
The project comprises two main components: a web interface built using Python and Django, and a set of automations developed using UiPath. The web interface allows users to log in, select the appropriate automation, and run it. The automations handle the actual processing tasks, such as downloading emails, extracting data, and generating XML files.

**Installation Manual**
This manual is divided into two sections: the Admin Part, which covers the setup and configuration of the web application and UiPath automations, and the User Part, which explains how end-users can utilize the system.

UiPath Invoices&Orders automations were developed with love by me specifically for use in company Pawbol Baltic❤️
